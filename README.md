Smart Lighting System using Arduino and Object Detection
Smart Lightng is an Arduino-based project that utilizes object detection to intelligently control lighting systems. With this project, you can automatically switch ON and OFF light bulbs based on the presence of a person in the room. This solution offers convenience, energy efficiency, and automation for various applications such as home automation, office spaces, and public buildings.

Features
Object Detection: Utilizes object detection techniques to detect the presence of a person in the room.
Automatic Control: Automatically switches ON the lights when a person is detected and turns them OFF when the person leaves the room.
Arduino Compatible: Developed using Arduino platform, making it accessible and easy to implement for Arduino enthusiasts and hobbyists.
Customizable: The code can be easily customized to adapt to different sensors, lighting systems, and room configurations.
Energy Efficient: Helps in reducing energy consumption by ensuring that lights are only turned on when needed.
Hardware Requirements
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor
Relay module
Light bulbs or LED strips
Connecting wires
Power supply
Installation and Setup
git clone https://github.com/sichilongom/smart-lightng.git
Hardware Setup:
Connect the PIR motion sensor and relay module to the Arduino board as per the circuit diagram provided.
Connect the light bulbs or LED strips to the relay module.
Upload Code:
Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to smart-lightng.ino.
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
Adjust Settings:
Adjust the sensitivity and timeout settings in the code as per your requirements.
Deploy:
Mount the PIR motion sensor in a suitable location in the room.
Ensure proper power supply to the Arduino and the connected components.
Usage
Once the setup is complete, the system will automatically detect the presence of a person in the room and control the lighting accordingly.
Test the functionality by entering and leaving the room to observe the lights switching ON and OFF.
